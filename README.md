## Overview
This is a tutorial that I followed and turned into a jupyter notebook in order to practice some introductory concepts with python and the pandas library for data analysis. I decided to post my walk-through with all of my 'self-teaching' comments for self-reference. I know it is absurdly long, but it is also an un-rushed engagement with the original tutorial, and displaying that part of the process can be valuable on it's own.

I would highly recommend this tutorial for beginners with python and pandas who are perhaps looking to get into data science questions, especially those with interest in video games, as this is the dataset that is explored here. :)
